Research results
================

.. note::
   This is a toy project to exercise reproducible research; research-wise, these results are pretty boring.


This project will apply various machine learning techniques to the following datasets:

* Wine Quality (see `winequality.names <https://github.com/master-ai-batch5/M05-mp-decaillet/blob/main/data/housing.names>`_)
* Boston House Prices (see `housing.names <https://github.com/master-ai-batch5/M05-mp-decaillet/blob/main/data/housing.names>`_)

The results of the analysis are shown below.
